AB_SA
========

The AB_SA ("Accessory-based source attribution") method aims at attributing the origin of bacterial strains associated to human cases or isolated in environment. 
AB_SA method relies on accessory genes and multinomial logistic model. AB_SA uses as input a list of enriched genes in the sources, it trains and tests the multinomial logistic models and can predict  genomes of strains with known sources
